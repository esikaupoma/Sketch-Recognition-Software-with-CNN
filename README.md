# Sketch Recognition Software with CNN
This is my university one-year group thesis project!
Sketch Recognition Software is an intelligent drawing assistant that helps users improve their drawing skills by providing real-time feedback on the accuracy of their sketches. This project leverages deep learning techniques to recognize and assess freehand drawings, offering valuable insights to enhance artistic expression.

## Overview

Artistic expression has been a fundamental aspect of human culture, evolving with advancements in technology. Our project explores the intersection of art and technology, aiming to provide a user-friendly software tool that leverages machine learning to recognize and evaluate sketched objects. By employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a substantial dataset, the software offers a remarkable 94% accuracy in identifying sketched objects. This work contributes to individual artistic expression and bridges the gap between technology and creativity, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in the realm of art.
